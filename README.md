Memorization of colors is not something new. It has been implemented in many experiments, with many different theories and in many different fields. The intention behind this experiment is implementation of two theories. 
A theory called iconic memory and a theory of color relations.
Iconic memory is use of visual short-term memory to capture a whole picture in a brief moment without understanding the details of it. Yet, the information is stored in the brain and can be used when needed. 
One of the experiments that plays a huge role in the creation of iconic memory is George Sperling’s experiment, where participants were given a display of letters for 50-milliseconds. 
After displaying the letters (3 rows with 3 letters each), participants were asked to write down the letters of a certain row depending on the “beep” sound. Surprisingly, participants were able to write the letters from asked row even though they couldn’t remember all the letters. 
It shows that brain stored the information and used it when needed. 
Color relations is experiment by Noah Sulman and Thomas Sanocki, in which they tested whether the harmony of colors affect the ability to memorize the pattern. In their experiment, participants were given a pattern of colors. 
First trial consisted of distinct inharmonious colors, meaning that colors were on different hue. Second trial consisted of colors which are on the same hue but with different saturation, brightness, they were harmonious. 
Results showed that harmonious colors were easier to remember. Based on participants’ feedback, harmonious colors were more appealing, thus easier to remember. 
The main question is, does Noah Sulman and Thomas Sanocki’s experiment affect the iconic memory?
